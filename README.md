# Network-Troubleshooting-Toolkit
A Linux-based TUI shell-script project for troubleshooting your network using Whiptail.

How to use this project?
(1) Clone this project or download its zip file.

(2) Run install.sh as './install.sh' in your Linux terminak (preferably Ubuntu or related distros). This will install all libraries that are required for running the main file in your terminal.

(3) After running 'install.sh', run this command as it needs to be downloaded separately 'sudo apt install speedtest-cli' (this is for network speed test).

(4) Now, you can run 'toolkit.sh' as 'bash toolkit.sh' in your terminal and it should work fine.

(5) There is also a logs option in the main menu with which you can see your toolkit usage logs - one is toolkit.log (which has all the logs of the toolkit usage), and the others are based on the toolkit usage according to date which will be automatically created every day you use this toolkit. These are available in the logs/ directory in the same folder.
